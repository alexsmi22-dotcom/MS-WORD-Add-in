# Changelog

All notable changes to Formula Inserter. Dates are release/pilot dates.

## [Unreleased] — internal pilot prep

### Added
- **Carbon-range shorthands** in R-group definitions — typing `C1-6 alkyl` or
  `C1-C6 alkyl` expands to `C₁–C₆ alkyl` (subscript counts, en-dash) on insertion;
  ordinary formulas like `C2H5` are left untouched.
- **More definition shorthands** — `opt sub` / `opt. subst.` → "optionally
  substituted …"; variable-count ranges like `n=1-3` → `n = 1–3`, and plain
  integer ranges (`4-6 membered`) get an en-dash. Substituent locants such as
  `indazol-3-yl` are left alone.
- **Sub-generic Markush definitions** — when an R-group definition references a
  nested label (e.g. `R1 = C1-6 alkyl substituted with R1a`), an input for the
  sub-group (`R1a`) appears automatically and is included in the inserted legend
  (line or table). Detection is transitive and ignores ordinary words.
- **Structured Markush tables** — R-group definitions can be inserted as a
  two-column **R-group | Definition** table (toggle "Insert as: Line / Table" in
  the Build pane) in addition to the inline "where R1 = …" line.
- **R-group legend** — when a built structure has R-groups, a definition box
  collects `R1 = …`, `R2 = …`, and insertion adds a "where R1 = …; R2 = …" line
  beneath the structure.
- **Stereochemistry**: isomeric SMILES (Chemical mode) renders wedge/hash bonds;
  Build mode adds wedge (`>`) and hash (`<`) stereo bonds.
- **Richer Markush atoms** in Build: `A` (any atom), `Q` (any heteroatom),
  `R`/`R1`/`R2`… (R-group attachment points), plus the existing `[C,N]` lists and
  `X` halogen — with a "Markush / query atoms" button row.
- **Automated test suite** (Jest + ts-jest): 445 tests over parsers, OMML
  emitter, formula library, builder, and the full compound dictionary. Run with
  `npm test`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): type-check, tests, dictionary validation,
  production build, manifest validation.
- **Equation numbering** — optional right-aligned **(I), (II), …** with a
  persistent counter and reset.
- **Structure provenance** — inserted structures carry molecular formula, MW,
  canonical SMILES, and OpenChemLib ID code in the image alt-text; the pane shows
  formula / MW / SMILES.
- **Markush / generic structures** in Build mode — `[C,N]` atom lists, `~`
  undefined/any bonds, and the `X` halogen shorthand.
- **Clickable palettes** (math + chemical), **Build bond buttons**, and **Build
  common-structure templates**.
- **Search** across formulas and compounds; **recents & favorites** (with a
  **Clear** control for confidentiality).
- **Formula library** (Statistics / Geometry / Algebra / Trigonometry / Calculus)
  and an extended math engine (Σ, ∫, ∏, roots, functions, |x|, limits, accents,
  factorials, implicit multiplication, literal Greek).
- **Confidentiality disclaimer** in the pane.
- Distribution, security, third-party-license, and user-guide docs;
  `manifest.prod.xml` template.

### Notes / known gaps (tracked for next iterations)
- Build wedge/hash bonds are indicative; for exact, parity-defined stereo prefer
  isomeric SMILES in Chemical mode.
- "Optionally substituted" shorthands and variable counts / C1–C6 alkyl ranges
  are not yet generated automatically. R-group legends are free-text (not yet a
  structured Markush table with sub-generic definitions).
- Sequence listings (WIPO ST.26) out of scope.
- Compound dictionary SMILES are validated to **parse**; a chemist should
  spot-verify chemical correctness before claim-critical use.
- Cross-platform (Mac / Word on the web) and a Content-Security-Policy need
  validation in-host during the pilot (see `SECURITY.md`).

## [0.1.0] — initial scaffold
- Office.js Word add-in: chemical & math formatting, 2D structures, native Word
  equations, Build mode.
