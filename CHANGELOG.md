# Changelog

All notable changes to Formula Inserter. Dates are release/pilot dates.

## [Unreleased] — internal pilot prep

### Added
- **Sequence mode (WIPO ST.26)** — generate a draft ST.26 sequence-listing XML
  from entered nucleotide (DNA/RNA) or protein (AA) sequences: per-sequence
  molecule type and organism, residue cleanup/validation (whitespace & numbering
  stripped, IUPAC ambiguity codes accepted, invalid residues flagged), applicant/
  title/application metadata, and a generated source feature with mol_type +
  organism qualifiers. Output can be downloaded as `.xml` or copied. Marked a
  drafting aid — validate in the WIPO Sequence tool before filing.
- **Code mode** — a new mode for **pseudocode/algorithm blocks** (bold control-flow
  keywords, optional line numbers, optional caption like "Algorithm 1: KeyGen") and
  **verbatim code listings** (monospace, whitespace-preserving, optional line
  numbers). Inserts as a clean monospace block with a live preview.
- **Popular-functions section** — palette groups and matching formula-library
  categories for the most-used functions by family: **Trig** (sin/cos/tan, recip,
  inverse), **Hyperbolic** (sinh…coth), **Log & exponential** (ln/log/lg/exp/log_b),
  **Special** (Γ, ζ, erf/erfc, sgn, sigmoid), and **Discrete & combinatorics**
  (C(n,k), P(n,k), factorial, gcd/lcm, mod, floor/ceil). ~30 more function names
  now render upright (sech, csch, coth, arsinh/arcosh/artanh, erf, sgn, Var, Cov,
  Tr, rank, …).
- **Collapsible palette groups** — the Math symbol palette is now an accordion
  (groups expand/collapse, state remembered per mode), so it stays clean as the
  symbol set grows; the formula-library dropdown is grouped into "Mathematics" and
  "Science & engineering".
- **Electrical-engineering & physics support** — new formula-library categories
  (Ohm/impedance/reactance/resonance/dB/phasors; E=mc², Schrödinger, Planck,
  de Broglie, uncertainty, Coulomb, gravitation, ideal gas) plus notation:
  **Dirac bra-ket** (`bra`/`ket`/`braket`), contour/multiple integrals
  (`oint`/`iint`/`iiint`), phasor `∠`, `ℏ`, `Ω`, Laplace `ℒ` / Fourier `ℱ`
  transforms, and `Re`/`Im` parts.
- **Domain notation & formula libraries** for non-chemistry practice areas —
  logic/set-theory/quantifier symbols (∀ ∃ ∈ ∉ ⊆ ∪ ∩ ∅ ∧ ∨ ¬ ⊕ ⇒ ⇔), blackboard-
  bold number sets (ℤ ℝ ℕ ℚ ℂ 𝔽 𝔼), `floor`/`ceil`/`norm` (⌊⌋ ⌈⌉ ‖‖), `partial`
  (∂), `nabla` (∇), upright `mod`, degree (°), and square-bracket grouping (e.g.
  `[S]` concentrations) — all typeable as words or inserted from new **Logic &
  sets / Number sets / Advanced** palette groups. Added formula-library categories
  for **Cryptography**, **Computer science / ML**, **Mechanical engineering**, and
  **Biology / assays**.
- **Centralized-deployment guide** (`packaging/CENTRALIZED-DEPLOY.md`) for IT
  admins to push the add-in via the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated Apps)
  instead of the per-user installer. Corrected `DISTRIBUTION.md` to describe the
  actual per-user **Developer Add-ins** install (the network-share Trusted Catalog
  method, which did not work on the target build, is no longer presented as the
  flow). The package script's stamped `manifest.xml` doubles as the validated
  deploy manifest.
- **Matrices & piecewise/cases** in the math engine — `matrix(a, b; c, d)` (rows
  separated by `;`, columns by `,`), with `pmatrix` / `bmatrix` / `vmatrix` for
  `( )`, `[ ]` and `| |` (determinant) delimiters, and `cases(x, if x>0; -x,
  otherwise)` for piecewise functions. All emit real Word equation objects (OMML)
  and render in the live preview; new palette "Matrices" group.
- **Carbon-range shorthands** in R-group definitions — typing `C1-6 alkyl` or
  `C1-C6 alkyl` expands to `C₁–C₆ alkyl` (subscript counts, en-dash) on insertion;
  ordinary formulas like `C2H5` are left untouched.
- **More definition shorthands** — `opt sub` / `opt. subst.` → "optionally
  substituted …"; variable-count ranges like `n=1-3` → `n = 1–3`, and plain
  integer ranges (`4-6 membered`) get an en-dash. Substituent locants such as
  `indazol-3-yl` are left alone.
- **Sub-generic Markush definitions** — when an R-group definition references a
  nested label (e.g. `R1 = C1-6 alkyl substituted with R1a`), an input for the
  sub-group (`R1a`) appears automatically and is included in the inserted legend
  (line or table). Detection is transitive and ignores ordinary words.
- **Structured Markush tables** — R-group definitions can be inserted as a
  two-column **R-group | Definition** table (toggle "Insert as: Line / Table" in
  the Build pane) in addition to the inline "where R1 = …" line.
- **R-group legend** — when a built structure has R-groups, a definition box
  collects `R1 = …`, `R2 = …`, and insertion adds a "where R1 = …; R2 = …" line
  beneath the structure.
- **Stereochemistry**: isomeric SMILES (Chemical mode) renders wedge/hash bonds;
  Build mode adds wedge (`>`) and hash (`<`) stereo bonds.
- **Richer Markush atoms** in Build: `A` (any atom), `Q` (any heteroatom),
  `R`/`R1`/`R2`… (R-group attachment points), plus the existing `[C,N]` lists and
  `X` halogen — with a "Markush / query atoms" button row.
- **Automated test suite** (Jest + ts-jest): 445 tests over parsers, OMML
  emitter, formula library, builder, and the full compound dictionary. Run with
  `npm test`.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): type-check, tests, dictionary validation,
  production build, manifest validation.
- **Equation numbering** — optional right-aligned **(I), (II), …** with a
  persistent counter and reset.
- **Structure provenance** — inserted structures carry molecular formula, MW,
  canonical SMILES, and OpenChemLib ID code in the image alt-text; the pane shows
  formula / MW / SMILES.
- **Markush / generic structures** in Build mode — `[C,N]` atom lists, `~`
  undefined/any bonds, and the `X` halogen shorthand.
- **Clickable palettes** (math + chemical), **Build bond buttons**, and **Build
  common-structure templates**.
- **Search** across formulas and compounds; **recents & favorites** (with a
  **Clear** control for confidentiality).
- **Formula library** (Statistics / Geometry / Algebra / Trigonometry / Calculus)
  and an extended math engine (Σ, ∫, ∏, roots, functions, |x|, limits, accents,
  factorials, implicit multiplication, literal Greek).
- **Confidentiality disclaimer** in the pane.
- Distribution, security, third-party-license, and user-guide docs;
  `manifest.prod.xml` template.

### Notes / known gaps (tracked for next iterations)
- Build wedge/hash bonds are indicative; for exact, parity-defined stereo prefer
  isomeric SMILES in Chemical mode.
- "Optionally substituted" shorthands and variable counts / C1–C6 alkyl ranges
  are not yet generated automatically. R-group legends are free-text (not yet a
  structured Markush table with sub-generic definitions).
- Sequence listings (WIPO ST.26) out of scope.
- Compound dictionary SMILES are validated to **parse**; a chemist should
  spot-verify chemical correctness before claim-critical use.
- Cross-platform (Mac / Word on the web) and a Content-Security-Policy need
  validation in-host during the pilot (see `SECURITY.md`).

## [0.1.0] — initial scaffold
- Office.js Word add-in: chemical & math formatting, 2D structures, native Word
  equations, Build mode.
